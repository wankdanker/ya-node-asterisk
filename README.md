# Yana

Yana is yet another node.js library for Asterisk Manager Interface.

Tested on Asterisk versions from 1.6.0 up to 11.

The library is still in early stage so the API may be a subject to change.

## Installation
Install with npm: `npm install yana`

## API
Connecting is as simple as this:
```js
var AMI = require('yana'),
    ami = new AMI({
      'port': 5038,
      'host': 'example.com',
      'login': 'login',
      'password': secret,
      'events': 'on'
    });
```

AMI is an EventEmitter and so it emits events of a few kinds:
 * 'connect' fires upon successful login
 * 'end' fires when the server sends a FIN packet
 * 'close' fires when the connection to the server is fully closed
 * 'error' fires on any connection related errors
 * 'event' fires on every event sent by Asterisk
It is possible to suscribe to specific Asterisk events by their names like 'FullyBooted' or 'PeerStatus'.
UserEvents also trigger events like 'UserEvent-EventName'.

For thorough documentation on available AMI commands check [Asterisk Wiki](https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/AMI+Actions).

## Example:
```js
    var util = require('util'),
        AMI = require('yana'),
        ami = new AMI({
            'port': 5038,
            'host': 'localhost',
            'login': 'login',
            'password': 'secret',
            'events': 'on'
        });

    ami.on('connect', function () {
        console.log('Connected');
    });

    ami.on('error', function(err) {
        console.log('An error occured: ' + err);
    });

    ami.on('FullyBooted', function (event) {
        console.log('Ready');
        ami.send({Action: 'ListCommands'}, function (err, res) {
            console.log(util.inspect(res));
        });
        setTimeout(function () {
            console.log('Disconnecting...');
            ami.disconnect();
            process.exit(0);
        }, 5000);
    });
```
